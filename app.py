    Downscaling refers to methods used to refine climate data from coarse global or reanalysis scales down to
    regional or local scales. It can be statistical or dynamical. Key reasons include:
    - Improving local weather and climate predictions
    - Supporting disaster planning and policy
    - Making maps and models more relevant to specific regions
