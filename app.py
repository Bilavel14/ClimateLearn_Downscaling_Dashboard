    with ERA5 precipitation data from 2010‚Äì2020. It provides interactive learning sections and maps that will be
    enhanced with analysis modules in future phases.

    Downscaling refers to methods used to refine climate data from coarse global or reanalysis scales down to
    regional or local scales. It can be statistical or dynamical. Key reasons include:
    - Improving local weather and climate predictions
    - Supporting disaster planning and policy
    - Making maps and models more relevant to specific regions

    ERA5 is the fifth-generation reanalysis dataset from ECMWF. It offers global hourly data at 31 km resolution.
    For this dashboard, we use **monthly total precipitation** (variable: `tp`) over **Northern Pakistan (2010‚Äì2020)**.
    
    The data is freely available through the [Copernicus Climate Data Store](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/).

    Climate models simulate the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere, land, ocean, and ice systems. They help in:
    - Forecasting future weather and climate
    - Understanding interactions between systems
    - Evaluating mitigation strategies

    Models are either **global** (GCMs) or **regional** (RCMs). Downscaling helps refine outputs from GCMs.

    NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a format for storing multi-dimensional climate and geospatial data.
    A typical NetCDF file contains:
    - Variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation)
    - Dimensions (time, latitude, longitude)
    - Metadata (units, source, time range)

    Python libraries like `xarray` and `netCDF4` allow easy reading and visualization.
